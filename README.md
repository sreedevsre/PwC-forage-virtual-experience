The PWC Job Simulation Forage project aims to simulate real-world job tasks for analyzing and visualizing business data using Power BI. This project focuses on three key datasets: Call Center, Churn, and Diversity &amp; Inclusion. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, we provide insights and visualizations that support data-driven decision-making.


Objectives
Data Analysis: Analyze call center performance, customer churn rates, and diversity & inclusion metrics.
Visualization: Create interactive and informative dashboards using Power BI.
Decision Support: Provide insights to aid strategic decision-making in various business operations.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Primary tool for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Data Sources: Three key datasets – Call Center, Churn, and Diversity & Inclusion.
